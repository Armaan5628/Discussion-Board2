I wrote most of the frontend and backend code myself, including the setup of routes, models, and UI components.
I did take help from ChatGPT in certain sections (for debugging, improving CSS design, and  toggling logic). However, I made sure to understand and integrate the code on my own.
This way, the project reflects both my own work and my ability to learn, research, and implement solutions with some guidance.
